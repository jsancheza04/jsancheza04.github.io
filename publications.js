        "abstract": "We analyze the effects of conflict-related violence on the mental health of caregivers and young children, as well as the role of caregivers' mental health in explaining the toll of conflict on early childhood mental health. Although an upcoming body of work has demonstrated the link between caregivers' and children's mental health, the role of caregivers' psychological constraints has been largely ignored in research and programming in conflict-affected settings. We demonstrate how these constraints play a role in the intergenerational transmission of mental health problems and emphasize the urgency of addressing caregivers' mental health within early childhood development programs in conflict-affected settings."

It investigates how various dimensions of poverty in these countries are associated with depressive symptoms among young people. The findings suggest that addressing multidimensional poverty is crucial for improving youth mental health in low- and middle-income countries."

        "abstract": "We examine the effect of the exposure (or reduction in the exposure) to conflictrelated violence on parental mental health, caregivers' parenting stress and responsive caregiving, and early childhood mental health. We use data collected from the impact evaluation of a psychosocial group intervention in Tumaco, Colombia, a community chronically affected by the armed conflict. Using an Instrumental Variables approach, we use the program's randomization into cohorts and staggered design of the data collection to exploit a natural experiment in which the armed groups in the municipality agreed to a Truce and municipal violence rates dropped between data collections. We find that the exposure to recent conflict-related violence had negative effects across the four main dimensions: increased parental mental health problems in 0.68 sd (SE=0.342 ; q-value=0.074), increased parenting stress in 0.76 sd (SE=0.389 ; q-value=0.074), reduced responsive caregiving in -1.023 sd (SE=0.434 ; q-value=0.074) and increased child mental health problems in 0.556 sd (SE=0.343 ; q-value=0.074). By providing causal evidence on the direct effect of conflict-related violence on parenting outcomes, we conduct an exploratory mediation analysis to assess whether parental mental health, parenting stress and responsive caregiving behaviors may partially account for the association between violence and child mental health. Yet, correlational links between violence and parental mental health and parenting behavior outcomes as mediators suggest important associations for understanding children's mental health vulnerability in conflict settings.

        "abstract":"Poverty is associated with poorer mental health in early adulthood. Cash transfers (CTs) have been shown to improve child health and education outcomes, but it is unclear whether these effects may translate into better mental health outcomes as children reach young adulthood. Using a quasi-experimental approach that exploits variation across countries in the timing of national CT programme introduction, we examine whether longer exposure to CTs during childhood (0–17 years) reduces depressive symptoms in early adulthood (18–30 years). Based on harmonized data from Colombia, Mexico, and South Africa (N = 14 431), we applied logistic regression models with country and birth-cohort fixed effects to estimate the impact of cumulative years of CT exposure on mental health, educational attainment, and employment outcomes. Our findings indicate that each additional year of CT exposure during childhood is associated with a 4% reduction in the odds of serious depressive symptoms in early adulthood [odds ratio (OR) = 0.96, 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 0.93, 0.98]. We find no consistent effect of years of exposure on completion of secondary school (OR = 1.01, 95% CIs: 0.99, 1.03) and a negative effect on the probability of employment in early adulthood (OR = 0.90, 95% CIs: 0.88, 0.91). These results suggest that longer exposure to CTs may contribute to modest but meaningful reductions in population-level depressive symptoms during early adulthood."
